## Medium- Ridge Plots

Change the plot you created in q13/14 to a ridge plot

```{r}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
surveys <- read_csv(here("week 2","lab 2","surveys.csv"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = surveys, 
       mapping = aes(x = weight, 
                     y = species)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() + 
       labs(x = "Weight", 
            y = " ", 
            title = "Distribution of Weight Within Each Species")

```
